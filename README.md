# Applying semi-empirical simulation of wildfire on real world satellite imagery data
## HOW TO USE THE SIMULATION
* Create a fresh Unity project and paste the contents of the "Unity Simulation" folder (the "Assets" folder) into the freshly created Unity project.

* Open the Unity project, run it using the run button at the top of the window.

* Go to scene view for better control.

* Choose an ignition point (must be within actual map bounds, i.e 483x483).

* The simulation will start (PS: You won't notice it if you choose an ignition point that is unburnable).

## Abstract 
The knowledge of a free-burning fireâ€™s potential rate of spread is critical for safe and effective bushfire control.

We are carrying out a data driven cellular automata simulation of wildfire propagation. 

In this work we also demonstrate how we extract useful data from satellite imagery and use machine learning techniques in order to prepare inputs used later for simulation.

We aim to locate critical zones and to estimate fire spread so that needed precautions can be taken to limit and control any eventual risks in real life, this can also help managers to rapidly predict the spread of fires, providing a decision basis for formulating effective fire extinguishing plans.

## Impact
Our solution can be helpful in many aspects of fire management in which the main impact is :

* Risk factor calculation and this would help firefighters to focus on areas with higher risk and develop better infrastructure.

* For planning firefighting strategies and this would help fire crews position equipment on the ground so that they can minimize damage and stay safe.

* For fire fighter training purposes and developing a scenario for training.
